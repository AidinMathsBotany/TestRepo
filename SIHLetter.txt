Dear Prof Higgins:

I am writing to let you know that I cannot work anymore than this. I need my space and like to retire soon.


I have taught MATH160 Since the Summer School of 2012 up until the latest one in 2016 (5 consecutive years). 
I have run teaching evaluation questionnaires every single year and have separate 
report/analysis for each year. 

However, I was wondering if I could get a summary of my analysis in one document? 
I am going to apply for a teaching position and would like to have this as part of my job 
application. I am not sure if this is possible or should I just submit each year’s report 
with my application? I’d really appreciate your help.




Yours sincerely,

Aidin Jalilzadeh (BSc, MSc, PhD)
